       "      <td>[1997-05-20] I had to go for a physical and I remember getting there, my wife drove us up, I was supposed to be there at 1:00 and it was 2 minutes to 1:00 when we got there. I checked my watch and said \"this is great, we're right on time, its a good thing we left when we did.\" We got in there and the nurse took me and had me step up on a scale, was weighing me. Then I got up on the table and the doctor came in, he had a deep voice. I remember the sound of his shoes walking, he had a nice firm walk He came in and started talking to me and gave me a shot I asked him what kind of shot it was and he said \"It's an ACD shot.\" My wife is a nurse (in reality) and we were trying to figure out what kind of shot that was. She said she didn't know. He gave me the shot in the upper part of my left arm and it was somewhat painful and I sort of winced a little bit, but I said it didn't hurt that badly. I asked him what it was and he said it was a cardiac shot, maybe hepatitis, I asked what the A was for and he said that was a shot for marijuana. I asked what he meant, and he said \"it lessens the effect of marijuana if you smoke it.\" I laughed and said \"Oh great! Now I'll have to smoke twice as much marijuana.\" And he laughed and I said \"no, I don't smoke marijuana\" [in reality, not for the last 25 years] . Then, while I was still on the table, there was a loud buzz, a doorbell, but the person rang it excessively long and it was excessively loud, and the doctor groaned \"oh boy\" but he went to the door and opened it. Then this man with a very effeminate voice came in and said he had flowers to deliver and the doctor said \"Oh gosh! Those weren't supposed to be delivered here!\" Then he called to his nurse \"Bevvv! Come in here and take care of this, these are supposed to be delivered (I think he said) to my wife.\" So she came in and took care of the man with the flowers. The next thing I remember I was out in my backyard sitting at a picnic table eating dinner with my mother and some other people. My mother was sitting right to my right. I don't remember what we were eating, but the yard was kind of sloped down and we were back towards the end of it and we were sitting there eating and talking. I mentioned to my mother that I had had a shot and said \"I bet I could probably drink beer now and I bet I could have a few now.\" [Reality, I have been a recovering and sober alcoholic for 14 years] And my mother said \"Oh, I don't know what I would do if I started to find beer bottles and found out that you were drinking again.\" I started to laugh and said \"well, you know there have been a number of times when I've had a few! It doesn't really bother me if I just drink beer and don't drink too much.\" She didn't sound too believing but said \"oh, that's interesting.\" My thoughts and been that maybe if this shot for marijuana was effective, it might allow me to drink like a regular drinker without having any bad effects from it. My mother left. They had all left and gone somewhere. I was by myself, and I thought I had better start cleaning up the dishes and I picked up my plate and I had a glass which I left there, and started to walk. I heard a splash and realized that I was right along side of a river and I didn't want to fall in the river, and I couldn't exactly remember which way I had to go to get up to my house. I was pretty sure I could feel that the land sloped a little bit, and I thought I was okay and so I started to walk in generally the right direction, but I sort of veered off to the side of my yard and got tangled up in some bushes that are there. I kept walking and at one point I brushed against a wire antenna that I have in my back yard in reality and I remember thinking \"boy this thing is really hanging too low. I should get a pole to prop up the middle with\" I kept walking and got myself straightened out and got up to the top near my house, where a patio is and a dishwasher was there, and I started to put my plate inside the dishwasher, and I was going to go back and get some more when I started to hear all these voices from inside my basement. It was my neighbor E from across the street, with a bunch of people and they were talking, it was as if she was giving them a tour of my house. Then she came out and started thanking me and then my mother came out and she thanked us both for being such nice people and being such good help. I remember saying \"E you're always welcome.\" Then she was leaving.</td>\n",

       "      <td>I was in a class, possibly for computer programming. There seemed to be many familiar people in the class with me and the instructor was very friendly and it seemed as if I was sitting in the front of the room and he was sitting in the back, and he came up to me and said \"I was going to buy you an \"Opticon\" but the administration wouldn't let me, they cost $6000 but I brought you a Braille writer and I bought you all this other stuff and I just wondered if you were familiar with it because you are going to need them in this class.\" I remember thinking \"I'm glad he didn't buy an Opticon because I don't remember how to use one. So I began to unpack the box he gave me, and there did appear to be an Opticon and had a little hand held camera with it. A little box that had something similar to a little Braille display, maybe a one line Braille display, maybe an Opticon. I started taking out this thing and all the accessories that came with it and I was amazed at the different plugs and cords and there were adapters like standard serial port adapters for computers, there were some that were offset between the male and female end of it. There were some wires with like plastic keys hanging off of them. My co-worker, M happened to be there then and she said \"Oh, this is interesting, you could probably stick this in a car's ignition to start it if you happened to lose your key.\" We had a laugh about that. I just kept looking at these different pieces. There was one piece that I fitted onto the back of the machine with a little flange, it was some sort of little plug. Throughout the dream everything seemed pretty familiar to me and I seemed to know what everything was for. Then M said she had to go and do an interview and I said \"where's everybody else?\" and she said \"I have no idea, they all left at 8:00 and they just left at 8:00 and I'm left with the work to do.\" [An Opticon is a device which converts printed material into tactile images that actually feel like the printed letters. It has largely gone out of vogue for the last 15 or 20 years.]</td>\n",

       "      <td>[1997-05-22] I was in the computer room in my basement here and my friend J's daughter was here with me. She was trying to print some stuff and I was helping her with the computer and I was asking her if she ever used Print-Shop. And we were talking about Q&amp;A and WordPerfect and I forgot to run my speech program and was having trouble figuring out where I was and she was kind of helping me. In the dream his daughter, who in reality is 40 sounded like she was 20. Next I remember being at the Guild for the Blind in Hingeville. I was walking through there smoking a pipe and the tobacco smelled really good, like cinnamon [I haven't smoked a pipe in 10 years in reality] . I was walking through there talking to some people and all of a sudden I could hear all these little kids coming in and somebody came over to me and said \"do you hear the fire?\" At first I said no, but then I heard some sirens off in the distance. They said it was next door at a restaurant which I remember having been in before. Then my wife was there and she was looking and I asked \"How bad does it look?\" and she said \"Oh, it's really a bad fire! A good one, really ablaze.\" Then she took me over there and we walked into the driveway and we could hear the men up above, working away on the roof. One of the firefighters yelled down \"What are you doing here? Get out of here now!\" And I responded \"I'm just glad I had a chance to hear this.\" I asked my wife again how it looked and she still said that it looked pretty bad. Then rain started to fall on us but it may have been water from the hose. I said, lets get out of this or we'll have to go home and take a bath. I also remember at some point, being able to smell the smoke, it had a rather acrid smell typical of house fires.</td>\n",

He had spoken during the meeting, it was a discussion meeting, and then 5 minutes before the meeting ended, he repeated, \"My name is B and I'm an alcoholic\" but then he got all emotional and choked up and couldn't finish what he had wanted to say. He was quite upset and distraught, and I could hear him almost beginning to break down.</td>\n",

       "      <td>[1997-06-05] I was in my office and I was going to go to lunch, walking over toward the coat rack I remembered saying \"I think I'm going to blow the rest of this day off.\" One of my co-workers was kidding me and she said \"I heard that!\" Then I was supposed to go to a meeting the Cleveland Blind Association and I went to the coat rack and I couldn't find my coat. I was feeling all the different coats, even reached into the pocket of one of them which felt similar to mine, and I found a bunch of balled up papers and different things and I realized that it wasn't my coat. I had to go through the whole coat rack one coat after another until I found mine. They all seemed to feel the same and I had a cab waiting for me so I was really in a hurry to go. I finally did find it, it was way over on the right hand end of the coat rack, probably took five minutes to go through all of the coats [That has never happened to me, I can usually reach right over and feel the texture of my coat.] So I went downstairs and I remember thinking \"Oh, at least the cab is coming right here for me I don't have to walk a couple blocks to meet it.\" The next thing I knew, I was at the Blind Association and I walked in. I couldn't remember exactly which way to go. The more I thought about it the more it seemed like the school for blind children that I went to as a kid, than the blind association. But I got there and was walking and one of the women who worked there was kind of helping me and she said \"now we turn to the right here\" then she grabbed me and said \"its very narrow here\" she thought I was going to bump into something. Then we ended up in a big open reception area in the front and again I was waiting for this cab. I don't know how I got to the Blind association but she said, I was right next to this big window in the front of the place, she said \"sit here in this prom chair\" and I said \"boy, I bet I'm less nervous today then when I went to the prom.\" Then we started talking about the prom and I said that neither of my kids had ever gone to the prom. I remember going to the bath room and then coming out and they said, \"Your cab was here but he didn't want to wait so he went to have lunch at the restaurant next door and he'll be back to pick you up.\" So I waited about 15 or 20 minutes and he never did come back to pick me up.</td>\n",

I went in and talked to the person, trying to decide what kind of nuts I wanted and I couldn't think of anything that sounded good because it was early in the morning and I didn't want peanuts and I didn't want any other kind, but I asked him though, if they had anything they could mix with chocolate covered raisins and they said they didn't have anymore chocolate covered raisins.  \n",
       "267  [1997-05-20] I had to go for a physical and I remember getting there, my wife drove us up, I was supposed to be there at 1:00 and it was 2 minutes to 1:00 when we got there. I checked my watch and said \"this is great, we're right on time, its a good thing we left when we did.\" We got in there and the nurse took me and had me step up on a scale, was weighing me. Then I got up on the table and the doctor came in, he had a deep voice. I remember the sound of his shoes walking, he had a nice firm walk He came in and started talking to me and gave me a shot I asked him what kind of shot it was and he said \"It's an ACD shot.\" My wife is a nurse (in reality) and we were trying to figure out what kind of shot that was. She said she didn't know. He gave me the shot in the upper part of my left arm and it was somewhat painful and I sort of winced a little bit, but I said it didn't hurt that badly. I asked him what it was and he said it was a cardiac shot, maybe hepatitis, I asked what the A was for and he said that was a shot for marijuana. I asked what he meant, and he said \"it lessens the effect of marijuana if you smoke it.\" I laughed and said \"Oh great! Now I'll have to smoke twice as much marijuana.\" And he laughed and I said \"no, I don't smoke marijuana\" [in reality, not for the last 25 years] . Then, while I was still on the table, there was a loud buzz, a doorbell, but the person rang it excessively long and it was excessively loud, and the doctor groaned \"oh boy\" but he went to the door and opened it. Then this man with a very effeminate voice came in and said he had flowers to deliver and the doctor said \"Oh gosh! Those weren't supposed to be delivered here!\" Then he called to his nurse \"Bevvv! Come in here and take care of this, these are supposed to be delivered (I think he said) to my wife.\" So she came in and took care of the man with the flowers. The next thing I remember I was out in my backyard sitting at a picnic table eating dinner with my mother and some other people. My mother was sitting right to my right. I don't remember what we were eating, but the yard was kind of sloped down and we were back towards the end of it and we were sitting there eating and talking. I mentioned to my mother that I had had a shot and said \"I bet I could probably drink beer now and I bet I could have a few now.\" [Reality, I have been a recovering and sober alcoholic for 14 years] And my mother said \"Oh, I don't know what I would do if I started to find beer bottles and found out that you were drinking again.\" I started to laugh and said \"well, you know there have been a number of times when I've had a few! It doesn't really bother me if I just drink beer and don't drink too much.\" She didn't sound too believing but said \"oh, that's interesting.\" My thoughts and been that maybe if this shot for marijuana was effective, it might allow me to drink like a regular drinker without having any bad effects from it. My mother left. They had all left and gone somewhere. I was by myself, and I thought I had better start cleaning up the dishes and I picked up my plate and I had a glass which I left there, and started to walk. I heard a splash and realized that I was right along side of a river and I didn't want to fall in the river, and I couldn't exactly remember which way I had to go to get up to my house. I was pretty sure I could feel that the land sloped a little bit, and I thought I was okay and so I started to walk in generally the right direction, but I sort of veered off to the side of my yard and got tangled up in some bushes that are there. I kept walking and at one point I brushed against a wire antenna that I have in my back yard in reality and I remember thinking \"boy this thing is really hanging too low. I should get a pole to prop up the middle with\" I kept walking and got myself straightened out and got up to the top near my house, where a patio is and a dishwasher was there, and I started to put my plate inside the dishwasher, and I was going to go back and get some more when I started to hear all these voices from inside my basement. It was my neighbor E from across the street, with a bunch of people and they were talking, it was as if she was giving them a tour of my house. Then she came out and started thanking me and then my mother came out and she thanked us both for being such nice people and being such good help. I remember saying \"E you're always welcome.\" Then she was leaving.  \n",

There seemed to be many familiar people in the class with me and the instructor was very friendly and it seemed as if I was sitting in the front of the room and he was sitting in the back, and he came up to me and said \"I was going to buy you an \"Opticon\" but the administration wouldn't let me, they cost $6000 but I brought you a Braille writer and I bought you all this other stuff and I just wondered if you were familiar with it because you are going to need them in this class.\" I remember thinking \"I'm glad he didn't buy an Opticon because I don't remember how to use one. So I began to unpack the box he gave me, and there did appear to be an Opticon and had a little hand held camera with it. A little box that had something similar to a little Braille display, maybe a one line Braille display, maybe an Opticon. I started taking out this thing and all the accessories that came with it and I was amazed at the different plugs and cords and there were adapters like standard serial port adapters for computers, there were some that were offset between the male and female end of it. There were some wires with like plastic keys hanging off of them. My co-worker, M happened to be there then and she said \"Oh, this is interesting, you could probably stick this in a car's ignition to start it if you happened to lose your key.\" We had a laugh about that. I just kept looking at these different pieces. There was one piece that I fitted onto the back of the machine with a little flange, it was some sort of little plug. Throughout the dream everything seemed pretty familiar to me and I seemed to know what everything was for. Then M said she had to go and do an interview and I said \"where's everybody else?\" and she said \"I have no idea, they all left at 8:00 and they just left at 8:00 and I'm left with the work to do.\" [An Opticon is a device which converts printed material into tactile images that actually feel like the printed letters.

She was trying to print some stuff and I was helping her with the computer and I was asking her if she ever used Print-Shop. And we were talking about Q&A and WordPerfect and I forgot to run my speech program and was having trouble figuring out where I was and she was kind of helping me. In the dream his daughter, who in reality is 40 sounded like she was 20. Next I remember being at the Guild for the Blind in Hingeville. I was walking through there smoking a pipe and the tobacco smelled really good, like cinnamon [I haven't smoked a pipe in 10 years in reality] . I was walking through there talking to some people and all of a sudden I could hear all these little kids coming in and somebody came over to me and said \"do you hear the fire?\" At first I said no, but then I heard some sirens off in the distance. They said it was next door at a restaurant which I remember having been in before. Then my wife was there and she was looking and I asked \"How bad does it look?\" and she said \"Oh, it's really a bad fire! A good one, really ablaze.\" Then she took me over there and we walked into the driveway and we could hear the men up above, working away on the roof. One of the firefighters yelled down \"What are you doing here? Get out of here now!\" And I responded \"I'm just glad I had a chance to hear this.\" I asked my wife again how it looked and she still said that it looked pretty bad. Then rain started to fall on us but it may have been water from the hose. I said, lets get out of this or we'll have to go home and take a bath. I also remember at some point, being able to smell the smoke, it had a rather acrid smell typical of house fires.  \n",

He had spoken during the meeting, it was a discussion meeting, and then 5 minutes before the meeting ended, he repeated, \"My name is B and I'm an alcoholic\" but then he got all emotional and choked up and couldn't finish what he had wanted to say. He was quite upset and distraught, and I could hear him almost beginning to break down.  \n",

I was feeling all the different coats, even reached into the pocket of one of them which felt similar to mine, and I found a bunch of balled up papers and different things and I realized that it wasn't my coat. I had to go through the whole coat rack one coat after another until I found mine. They all seemed to feel the same and I had a cab waiting for me so I was really in a hurry to go. I finally did find it, it was way over on the right hand end of the coat rack, probably took five minutes to go through all of the coats [That has never happened to me, I can usually reach right over and feel the texture of my coat.] So I went downstairs and I remember thinking \"Oh, at least the cab is coming right here for me I don't have to walk a couple blocks to meet it.\" The next thing I knew, I was at the Blind Association and I walked in. I couldn't remember exactly which way to go. The more I thought about it the more it seemed like the school for blind children that I went to as a kid, than the blind association. But I got there and was walking and one of the women who worked there was kind of helping me and she said \"now we turn to the right here\" then she grabbed me and said \"its very narrow here\" she thought I was going to bump into something. Then we ended up in a big open reception area in the front and again I was waiting for this cab. I don't know how I got to the Blind association but she said, I was right next to this big window in the front of the place, she said \"sit here in this prom chair\" and I said \"boy, I bet I'm less nervous today then when I went to the prom.\" Then we started talking about the prom and I said that neither of my kids had ever gone to the prom. I remember going to the bath room and then coming out and they said, \"Your cab was here but he didn't want to wait so he went to have lunch at the restaurant next door and he'll be back to pick you up.\" So I waited about 15 or 20 minutes and he never did come back to pick me up.
