The corpse is covered with a sheet and there is blood all over the walls of the school. The atmosphere is tense and everyone gets angry because rumors say that the assassin is still on school grounds. Then this crime story disappears and we start playing volleyball. Then the bell rings, all the classes gather in rows in the same places as in the past. But in the row, an old childhood friend hits me, we start fighting on the floor, I realize it's my cousin but we keep fighting and at one point he turns into my current cat, but with blood all over the place, he limps away, jumps the low wall that surrounds the school, jumps into a passing car (a big car converted into a house that I'm sure I've seen <mark style='background-color: yellow'>in another dream</mark> that night). The car pulls away and the cat stares at me sadly. And I start crying because I know I won't see him again and I feel guilty for hitting him.

J [my ex who has recently been in a relationship] suggested that we go to a restaurant. I declined, to which he replied that it was important that we talk about how we feel. There were a lot of people in the room, maybe in their 30s, all talking a little in all directions. I was leaving but I turned around and yelled that it was his fault that he had gone paired up. Everyone shut up and looked at me (<mark style='background-color: yellow'>I don't remember</mark> a sequel).</td>\n",

I walk around with two suitcases that I have received <mark style='background-color: yellow'>I don't remember</mark> from whom and for what occasion. I find it funny to have received two, because normally I should have received only one. I know I'm happy. It seems to me that I am coming out of work, which I do not know. I am satisfied because I worked. I don't know if it was voluntary work or if I earned money. I feel relieved that the job is done. I walk towards the Coulouvrenière bridge towards the Stand tram stop (direction Plainpalais). I'm curious to know what I received in the suitcase. I stop on the way and open one of the suitcases containing, among other things, three ties. I'm going somewhere. The place looks like the mall where I was before (in the dream with my sister-in-law). I have just come down these spiral stairs when a man tries to take my suitcase which I had opened before. I tell him to let go and leave me alone. He doesn't seem to have understood or listened to me because he's following me. When I find myself in a corner in a kind of room with glass everywhere (like the entrance to a shopping center in an underground car park). It's not me anymore but another young girl. The man becomes threatening and I believe that the girl understood that he wanted to sexually abuse her. The girl, I don't know how, manages to escape and call for help. Not far from there is another man. She goes to him to help and protect her. The man approaches her and enters the glazed room. The young girl, relieved at first, panics when she realizes that the man is blocking the sliding glass door behind him. She is scared that he is an accomplice of the other man. (Here in the dream it's pretty unclear if they abused her or not, who, how and etc... But I'm pretty sure she was sexually assaulted. I feel helpless. I wish so much to be able to do something, to smash the face of these two men. At the same time, I am also relieved that it is no longer me in the dream).</td>\n",

There were a lot of people that I didn't stare at except one of my friends/boyfriends who didn't inspire me with confidence. He's scammed me several times already. His phone started ringing and the listening was not good. In a series of hello hello, he went out to find the best network and suddenly I wanted to follow his conversation. Suddenly his same brand of phone appeared to me and I put it in his ear. I strangely listen to what the correspondent was saying on the other end of the line and he didn't since he continued to say hello hello. The correspondent kept saying, I'm talking to him and he's not even listening. I kept listening and then she started crying. The problem is that this correspondent was my fiancée.
