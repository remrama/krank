I stood with my legs folded in my arms on my chair to look less involved and to be less affected. I laughed with L from time to time so the same goal. -The shrinks who looked at us with a contemptuous air seemed to say �no, but who are these people, they are completely cracked�. Before the session I told shrink 1 that I didn't want to tell everything that happened again. She gave me the impression that she was in a hurry, that she had no time for my little whims and that I was bothering her. When I wanted to sit on the sofa she said no and by her look I understood that she meant �no but where does she think she is?� In short, I was not taken into account by the shrinks, I was just there so that my father would prove me wrong in front of them.

Suddenly, I go home from the bus [there is about 30 minutes on foot uphill and I pass in front of my cousins. I had not done this path for a long time, but the fact of having done it two days before made me dream of it]. Arriving in front of my cousins ????cousins ??I find that the atmosphere is strange since there are 5-6 people on the road, on foot, while it is usually deserted. Indeed, someone is armed, so to save someone in danger I position myself between and receive a bullet in the back. At that moment I feel pain, not related to the injury but to my worry. I think indeed of my parents eb not asking who will warn them, who will find me and what they will become if something happens to me.

The spectators can only view the show by standing in the wet area and has water up to my ankles. This water area also has some colourful fish that are sensitive to motion.

I was scared that the horse didn't trust me and i was super scared that the horse wasn't going to let me ride, but luckily he did. I remember the instructor played a video of how to ride the horse and that pulling on the ropes attached to the horse will let the horse know when to stop. thats all i remember about the dream.

I was so happy with how i looked i started feeling more confident about going. My dad asked me where i was going and he didn't seem to happy. He gave me a curfew of 12am. I went to the party using an uber and i took my brother with me. When i got there i knew almost everyone! The people that were there were people i knew in high school. This was a pleasant dream because i seen the faces of people id hadn't seen in the past 4 years out of high school.

I hadn't seen this aunt in years and i remember asking my brother if he wanted to leave because i was very nervous seeing her. We ended up staying and i met my cousins for the first time and i remember crying non-stop. After that I received a call from one of my older cousins asking for my brother and I to stop by her house however we did no because it was too late.

We were both excited about the music we selected but was anxious about the choreography and when we'll begin creating. The dream was pleasant yet bittersweet.

There was another stranger beside me and she asked me to not get in there and that this place had been closed for some time now. She also said that no one has seen the witch come out or into the house. For some strange reason I wanted to go in and I kept knocking on the sealed doors. They suddenly opened and I went in. There was a very low class/traditional hearth on the floor and an old lady who seemed a little like my grandma was sleeping on a pit of ash beside the hearth. I went close to her and she woke up and appeared in several places around the house but never looked directly at me. It was creepy and I was very uncomfortable. So I tried to leave the place and all of a sudden an uniformed group of people appeared in the house and they were blocking the doors. Everytime I tried to run out they threw me back inside. Somehow I found out that the lady had put a spell on everybody to be her slaves for the rest of their lives. Soon something also took control of me and I surrendered to others and did everything (chores and guarding the house) that a voice asked me to do. It was not a pleasant dream.

I was excited and happy to do this and I thought that I developed some sort of high mental status to be able to do this. I was talking to my self about things I should try out with this power.

One of my friend's mom and dad came with them  in a brokedown car. Her mom talked kindly and asked me to get in and said that they'd look after me. I was happy to see them.

I decided to steal a box of crayons becuase I liked the colours so much. some how with no indication the class ended and when i walked out it was already night. I asked the princess to come along with me and few other kids to hang out for some time. she came along. Then we all started smoking some sort of drug.

As I was walking I noticed two tigers drinking water from this lake. I thought it was a pleasant sight and decided to stop on the lake and just watch them. I was also not wearing any shoes and I couldn't see what I was wearing because it was through my eyes that I saw the surroundings. However when I stepped on to the lake I for some reason looked down at my feet.

the second time I woke up I remember my dream more clearly and it being very abstract.
I was trying to save little fuzzy animals (they looked nothing like the animals we know - more like tiny white clouds with rabbit ears) from a toad which wanted to eat them. It was not threatening at all and I recall laughing and ""teasing"" the toad as it tried to jump and grab the furry animal things from my arms."

In the dream, I along with three other people I cannot recognize are in an underground stadium fighting these cartoon aliens.

One hand on the back of my head, another between my shoulder blades, and another on my lower back.

I ran again, him right on my heels. A door appeared at the end of the hall - it was to the lobby, which was full of people.

My great-aunt passed away about ten years ago. While hearing her voice startled me, I found great comfort in hearing these words being spoken. Almost akin to being wrapped by a warm blanket during a cold winter night. When my great-aunt spoke, I remember not being able to see my other family members. Before this moment, my family members were visible and smiling with delight. Overall, the dream was pleasant but I was taken aback upon hearing the sound of my great-aunt.

We were in a wooden boat outside of what seemed to be a towering castle aligned with totems of fire. The castle itself was not visible due to the smoke created by the fire. Yet, a large wall was visible. It seemed that our common goal was to find a way past this wall. Suddenly, what seemed to be a simple moat turned into a winding path of water. We somehow managed to find our way to the entrance of the wall. The entrance was not visible but we knew it was contained within the wall. However, the wall shifted into a dimly lit tunnel through which we could enter the castle. As we were heading into the tunnel, a bright light suddenly appeared! I woke up at this moment and could not fall back to sleep. I have to say that I felt uneasy during the dream. The wall of the castle posed such an unfathomable task along with its chameleon-like presence. Overall, the dream was unpleasant and frustrating as it was inconclusive.

The ceiling had wavelike indigo and cyan fluorescent lights while the room itself was dimly lit. There was a wedding party in an adjacent room and I could see a wall filled with ornate bottles. The wedding party was very large and everything about the dream seemed unfamiliar. Many of the individuals in my dream varied in age but were primarily older. I remember someone breaking their leg and I was trying to help stabilize their leg with a makeshift splint. A few people and I were helping this person to the hospital.

The room itself was sepia with winding staircases and there were soldiers dressed in uniforms from WWII. The soldiers appeared like statues and were devoid of any expressions. There were instruments in which one had to play a certain tune to open the door to the next winding staircase. However, one instrument was completely out of tune and thus we were unable to escape to the next winding staircase. I ended up waking up at this time because Mocha was barking.

She controlled humans by a device akin to helmets that acted as a secondary brain. A few individuals (an older male and two older females) and I were able to obtain a mind controlling helmet, as to study the mechanism and technology behind it. Later in my dream, we somehow figured out a way to use the helmet against the nefarious matriarch. I woke up at this time as it was heavily raining outside.

We were in a frozen and snow-covered place when arriving near a building, the ground subsided. Loris and I fell into a sort of room, round, also frozen and seemingly uninhabited for a long time. She had old furniture and bed. The rest of the group joins us. I then explored the room and the corridor leading to it. After dark, Loris and I stayed to sleep in the bed. During the night, a kind of ghost sticks small pieces of yellow paper on the wall. When we wake up, we call on a specialist. He tells me nothing in particular. (The only interesting thing is that I seem to know him and have some importance in strange phenomena). Loris and I go to bed and try to picture what happened, he sees a ghost's hand glued to these pamphlets (which had nothing written on them, just the color yellow) making strange and threatening noises. I do the same thing and see the same things with one difference, the ghost doesn't make a sound, it says my name. This specialist then teaches us that this spirit is known as Alice (from the name of the book Alice in Wonderland), who he looks like after the fact and that he is a killer. We stay in the house and suddenly see a kind of completely deformed little child. I go to him and play with it, but suddenly he runs away and tries to run after him but he crashes into a wall and disappears, going through it. It was the son of the spirit. Alice (so the spirit) appears and introduces herself as an old college friend, Sophie, claiming to want revenge. I try to reason with her but it doesn't work. All my relatives and specialists in this kind of events then meet at my house (my house having become the one where the room was) for an emergency summons. I think I wake up at this time."

Sometimes a dog runs behind us to eat what we have in our hands, sometimes not. When he follows us, he is sometimes nice, sometimes mean. When he's mean, you have to be very careful because he could transform. It only happens once he transforms so we suffocated him but I don't see the scene where someone does.

Just as upset, I find myself in the skin of Hélène Quittu (me) yesterday. I saw again the face of the student who doesn't want to change rooms next year (she's settled in the only adapted room at Blanc Gravier). I also see the lady at the reception with her annoyed and helpless look (as if to say, I don't know how to do anything). I see again the objects-furniture of the room and especially of the unsuitable bathroom. I realize that it is no longer up to accessibility standards anyway (the building was built 20 years ago). I imagine the disabled student already not knowing how to go to the toilet because there are no handles around the potty. The bathroom is old. The lady at the reception tells me that her managers, building managers, do not want to do anything and want to leave this room to current non-disabled students. I am revolted, irritated, nothing is adapted the only adapted room is occupied by students who do not want to move and no one seems to want to change things. I imagine contacting my manager who has more influence than me to change things but already thinks that it will take forever for me to get an appointment to explain the situation to her and thinks that this problem is not not his priority. I will still try to contact her, I tell myself. My dream ends there, I remain frustrated and angry. I wake up for a moment thinking to myself, it's not true."

More often than not, I control my dreams, they are things I desire or repress. This means that I master all the characters, all the places, etc. Tonight, two things seem strange to me in the content of my dreams. The first is a helicopter crash in a nearby concession from my childhood in Cameroon. The device appeared to suppress a demonstration. It passed very low above our heads in the street and crashed a few seconds later in the courtyard of the neighbors of my family compound. All occupants are dead. They were white people I didn't know, all dressed in black jackets.

There were a lot of people that I didn't stare at except one of my friends/boyfriends who didn't inspire me with confidence. He's scammed me several times already. His phone started ringing and the listening was not good. In a series of hello hello, he went out to find the best network and suddenly I wanted to follow his conversation. Suddenly his same brand of phone appeared to me and I put it in his ear. I strangely listen to what the correspondent was saying on the other end of the line and he didn't since he continued to say hello hello. The correspondent kept saying, I'm talking to him and he's not even listening. I kept listening and then she started crying. The problem is that this correspondent was my fiancée.
